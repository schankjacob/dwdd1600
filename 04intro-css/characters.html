        <h1>Character Sheet Tour</h1>
        <p>
            In Dungeons and Dragons, each character is unique. They all have their own abilities, strengths, and weaknesses. To make them so unique, D&D characters have quite a lot of stats to keep track of. Luckily, we can write them all down! A <strong>character sheet</strong> is a piece &lpar;or two&rpar; of paper where you keep track of the details of your character. Here, we'll give you an overview of each part of the standard character sheet provided by Wizards of the Coast. You can get more details about how to fill your character sheet out in the <a href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/basic-rules/step-by-step-characters" target="_blank" rel="noopener">official rules here</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
            We can break the character sheet into four easy chunks:
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li><a href="#characterdetails">Character details</a></li>
            <li><a href="#abilityscores">Ability scores</a></li>
            <li><a href="#combatinfo">Combat information</a></li>
            <li><a href="#equipmentabilities">Equipment and abilities</a></li>
        </ol>
        <h2 id="characterdetails">Character Details</h2>
            <p>
                The top of the character sheet is where you keep the most basic information about your character, such as their name, race, and class. Additionally, there are spaces for your character's <strong>background</strong>&mdash;the archetype representing their basic history before they began adventuring&mdash;and their moral <strong>alignment</strong>.
            </p>
            <p>
                On the right side of the page are four boxes that help you roleplay your character accurately. The <strong>personality traits</strong> section is where you record specific quirks your character has. <strong>Ideals</strong> are the principles your character follows, while <strong>bonds</strong> are things that your character cares about, such as a friend, a lover, or a hometown. Finally, <strong>flaws</strong> are your character's vices and personal obstacles to overcome.
            </p>
        <h2 id="abilityscores">Ability Scores</h2>
            <p>
                On the left side, you'll see six boxes. These are the six core <strong>ability scores</strong>. Here's an explanation of what each one does.
            </p>
            <dl>
                <dt>
                    <strong>Strength</strong>
                </dt>
                <dd>
                    Your character's brawn; determines how much weight they can carry and how hard they can hit with most melee attacks.
                </dd>
                <dt>
                    <strong>Dexterity</strong>
                </dt>
                <dd>
                    How nimble your character is; determines how quickly they can react in combat and how hard they are to hit with an attack.
                </dd>
                <dt>
                    <strong>Constitution</strong>
                </dt>
                <dd>
                    Your character's physical sturdiness and general healthiness; determines how many hit points they have.
                </dd>
                <dt>
                    <strong>Intelligence</strong>
                </dt>
                <dd>
                    How book-smart your character is; determines how strong a wizard's magic is.
                </dd>
                <dt>
                    <strong>Wisdom</strong>
                </dt>
                <dd>
                    How intuitive and street-smart your character is; determines the magical strength of clerics, druids, and rangers.
                </dd>
                <dt>
                    <strong>Charisma</strong>
                </dt>
                <dd>
                    Your character's force of personality; determines the magical strength of bards, paladins, sorcerers, and wizards.
                </dd>
            </dl>
            <p>
                To the right of these six scores, you'll find spots for <strong>saving throws</strong> and <strong>skills</strong>. Your saving throw modifiers help you get out of tough situations, and your skill modifiers help you accomplish difficult tasks. Both are affected by your six ability scores.
            </p>
        <h2 id="combatinfo">Combat Information</h2>
            <p>
                In the center of your character sheet, you'll find a few more critical aspects of your character. Your <strong>armor class</strong> determines how hard you are to hit with an attack. Your  <strong>initiative</strong> determines how well you can react at the beginning of combat, while your <strong>speed</strong> determines how quickly you can move during combat. Your <strong>hit points</strong> determine how much damage you can take before falling unconscious, and your <strong>hit dice</strong> help you heal outside of combat. The <strong>death saves</strong> field helps you keep track of some important dice rolls determining whether your character actually dies if they fall in combat. Finally, there's a section to help you keep track of some go-to <strong>attacks & spellcasting</strong> your character may employ.
            </p>
        <h2 id="equipmentabilities">Equipment and Abilities</h2>
            <p>
                That's almost everything! There are just a couple more fields that help you remember everything your character can do. The spot at the bottom is a place to record your <strong>equipment</strong> &lpar;including money&rpar; they may carry on their person. The lower right is a spot to record your character's <strong>features & traits</strong> &lpar;such as any abilities they may gain from their race or class&rpar;, and the the lower left is a spot for any <strong>other proficiencies & languages</strong> your character may have: any other specific skills they're good at.
            </p>
            <p>
                And that's it! It may seem like a lot at first, but grouping them into these four sections simplifies it quite a bit. The top right provides <strong>character details</strong> to help you roleplay. The <strong>ability scores</strong> section on the left help you as you make dice rolls to affect the world around you. The <strong>combat</strong> section in the middle specifically helps you when in a fight, and the bottom <strong>equipment and abilities</strong> section provides your character with the specific tools they need for success. Hopefully, this guide will help you understand your character a bit more, and help you keep track of everything you can do in the game!
