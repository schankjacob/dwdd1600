        <h1>About D&D</h1>
        <p>
            Have you ever wished you were in a fantasy adventure? Well, look no further than Dungeons and Dragons! D&D is a tabletop roleplaying game &lpar;TTRPG&rpar; owned by Wizards of the Coast. As a TTRPG, it's not like a typical board game; rather than trying to earn points or be the first to the end, D&D focuses on collaboration, improvisation, and storytelling. Don't worry, though, there's plenty of strategy and action!
        </p>
        <p>
            In D&D, the player controls a fictional fantasy character of their own creation. Working with the <strong>Dungeon Master</strong>, they tell a story of the player characters' adventure together! Each story created is called a <strong>campaign</strong>, which often spans several game sessions &lpar;it can be just one; this is often called a <strong>one-shot</strong>&rpar;. Each session of D&D is typically 3-4 hours, although it can be shorter or longer as needed. The stories you craft together can be about anything, but common stories typically involve completing a quest of some sort, whether it be defeating a monster or villain, exploring and looting a dungeon, or even solving a mystery or crime.

            <em>For this basic introduction, we'll be using the rules for Dungeons and Dragons 5th edition, as it's currently the most commonly played version. You can find these rules on <a href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/basic-rules" target="_blank" rel="noopener">D&D Beyond's website here</a>.</em>
        </p>
        <h2>
            The Players
        </h2>
        <p>
            As stated before, the players each create their own character for each campaign. They keep the information about their character on their <strong>character sheet</strong> &lpar;<a href="characters.html">learn more here</a>&rpar;. Since D&D is a fantasy roleplaying game, your character can be any of a number of fantastical <strong>races</strong>, including &lpar;but not limited to&rpar; elves, dwarves, halflings, gnomes, half-orcs, dragonborns, and tieflings. However, it's your <strong>class</strong> which determines what your character can do&mdash;how they fight, what abilities they have, etc. Here's a list of the twelve basic classes of D&D and a simple explanation of each one.
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Barbarian</strong>: a raging warrior who fights with brute force</li>
            <li><strong>Bard</strong>: a versatile spellcaster who uses eloquence and music to strengthen allies and befuddle foes</li>
            <li><strong>Cleric</strong>: a divine healer who fights in the name of a deity</li>
            <li><strong>Druid</strong>: a spellcaster who uses nature magic and can transform into animals</li>
            <li><strong>Fighter</strong>: a versatile warrior who uses strategy and skill to fight</li>
            <li><strong>Monk</strong>: a nimble martial artist who channels their life force into their fighting</li>
            <li><strong>Paladin</strong>: a holy warrior who gains divine power from their oath</li>
            <li><strong>Ranger</strong>: a wilderness expert trained to fight and thrive within a chosen environment</li>
            <li><strong>Rogue</strong>: a sneaky thief skilled in working and fighting from the shadows</li>
            <li><strong>Sorcerer</strong>: a spellcaster with innate, often chaotic magical abilities</li>
            <li><strong>Warlock</strong>: a spellcaster who made a deal with a powerful being for their magic</li>
            <li><strong>Wizard</strong>: a spellcaster who gained magic through hard study</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            A group of player characters, called a <strong>party</strong>, uses their various abilities to fight monsters, solve puzzles, and overcome obstacles. Additionally, each character has their own personality and motivations. Players roleplay as their characters to create intercharacter dialogue, adding emotion, tension, and depth to the story being built. This aspect of D&D creates an extra layer to the game, helping players become invested and have fun!
        </p>
        <h2>
            The Dungeon Master
        </h2>
        <p>
            The Dungeon Master &lpar;DM&rpar; is essentially the referee of each game session. They prepare beforehand, creating the fictional world the characters reside in. During the game, they roleplay as every other character in this world. This gives players total freedom to do whatever they want in the game while expounding the results of their actions.
